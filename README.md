# 👋 Hi, I'm Jorge

### 🔬 Neuroscience • Microscopy • Image Analysis • Electrophysiology • Computational Biology 

Neuroscience researcher since 2009.

Interested in understanding the biology of the nervous system at different levels (from synapses to networks) using photonic microscopy, electrophysiology, and molecular modeling. 

Also interested in analysis methods to reliably and effciently link biological data with information (or at least trying to).
